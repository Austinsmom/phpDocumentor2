Renderer
========

To render the documentation for a project it is necessary to implement a flexible system that is capable
of outputting various types of documents based on a template definition.

Concepts
--------

Template
    This is a configuration file containing the workflow that needs to be executed when rendering the documentation.

Action
    This is a single step in the template workflow that can perform a single task.

Assets
    An Action may need to rely on files such as twig templates or images; these are assets.

Artefacts
    An Action may generate one or more artefacts; these are for example the HTML files generated by phpDocumentor.

Renderer
    Actions may invoke Renderers to generate an Artefact; examples are the generation of Twig templates

ReadModel
    Actions may consume an instance of the ReadModel to populate variables with

Query
    Actions may be restricted to a specific part of the view; if that happens to be a numerical array than an action
    will be invoked repeatedly for each element in that array.

[NEW] RenderContext
    When rendering an action there are several Value Objects that are populated based on settings or decisions within
    the application such as the Artefacts location and the ReadModels (they are based on the generated Documentation
    object). In order to supply this context in a generic way to each Action we have a RenderContext object that can
    be passed to each Action.
